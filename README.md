## About Glut32 and FreeGlut

Glut32, originally written by Mark Kilgard, was ported by Nate Robins. You can find the ported Glut32 binaries at [this link](http://www.xmission.com/~nate/glut.html). However, it has not been updated since 2001.

As an alternative, FreeGlut was created to provide a modern and actively maintained replacement for Glut32. FreeGlut offers the same set of functions for use with OpenGL and simplifies the process of programming 3D graphics with OpenGL.

For Windows users, you can download FreeGlut from [this link](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/index.php#download). Look for the appropriate package for your operating system.

Please note that the installation process may vary depending on the platform and development environment you are using. Refer to the respective documentation and resources for more detailed instructions.
