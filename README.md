Its in there where you will see the MinGW download package that Is described in this tutorial. ( NOTE : Latest Binary release is dated May 11th 2013 known as Martin Payne's Windows binaries. )

Download freeglut 2.8.1â€‘1 for MinGW --------> freeglut-MinGW-2.8.1-1.mp.zip

This was in reference to Windows and Linux packages according to their website.

When Glut32 was ported over it stopped being updated in 2001. So some folks decided to recreate it and named it FreeGlut. The interesting part is freeGlut and Glut32 can be installed just about the same way for Code::Blocks, with the exception that you would not have to edit the two scripts if your installing Glut32. FreeGlut and Glut32 are a set of functions for use with OpenGL. It has made graphic software a little easier to code when it comes to programming OpenGL with 3D in mind.
